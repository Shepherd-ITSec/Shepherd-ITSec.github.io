During my previous studies at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, I gained expertise in cutting-edge cybersecurity concepts. Following that, I worked at Fraunhofer FKIE, focusing on developing innovative reverse engineering methods. In recent years, I have worked as a Cyber Defense Consultant for TÜV Nord and PROCYDE, specializing in 5G communication and the security of Kubernetes systems.',
