## Hello, my name is Felix SchÃ¤fer 
I am an independent and experienced computer scientist, currently studying Cybersecurity and AI at Radboud University Nijmegen. During my previous studies at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤t Bonn, I gained expertise in cutting-edge cybersecurity concepts. Following that, I worked at Fraunhofer FKIE, focusing on developing innovative reverse engineering methods. In recent years, I have worked as a Cyber Defense Consultant for TÃœV Nord and PROCYDE, specializing in 5G communication and the security of Kubernetes systems.
